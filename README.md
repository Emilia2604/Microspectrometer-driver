# Microspectrometer-driver
Driver for microspectrometer Hamamatsu C12880MA.  Firmware is realized using STM. Application is on Raspberry pi 4B, is written  in python.

File main.c is code to STM. I use STM32F401CCU2. Other files, I wrote on Raspberry pi 4B. I made two PCB plates. The frist is driver to microspectrometer, with STM32. Second PCB is light source.
